p245_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p245_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.

p245_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p245_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p245_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p245_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p245_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p245_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p245_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p245_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.

p245_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.

p245_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p245_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p245_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p245_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p245_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p245_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.

p226_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p226_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
