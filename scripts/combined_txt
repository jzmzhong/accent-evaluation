p252_006: When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p252_007: The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p252_008: These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p252_009: There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p252_010: People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p252_011: When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p252_012: Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p252_013: Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p252_014: To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p252_015: The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p252_016: The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p252_017: Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p252_018: Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p252_019: Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p252_020: Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p252_021: The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored bands increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p252_022: The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-position of a number of bows. 
p252_023: If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p252_024: This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
